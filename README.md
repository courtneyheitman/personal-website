## Deploy

### Netlify

This theme is pre-configured to deploy with [Netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/create-deploys/).

> 💡 If you experience bundle install issues during the Netlify deployment, deleting the Gemfile.lock can sometimes help

### GitHub Pages

This theme works with GitHub Pages. If you are creating a GitHub Pages "Project site" then your site will be in a sub-folder ie `http://username.github.io/repository` You will need to update the `baseurl` in the `_config.yml` for the asset paths to work correctly.

```yaml
# _config.yml
baseurl: "/my-repo-name" # This should be the name of your repo
```
