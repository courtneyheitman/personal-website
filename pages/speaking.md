## Current Talks
**Navigating Screen Readers**  
Are you intimidated by operating a screen reader? For most sighted individuals using a screen reader is something they've never done before. If you're a developer or a QA that is producing accessible products using a screen reader becomes something that we must use for our jobs. And frankly, learning how to use one is not a easy feat.

This talk will go over how screen readers interact with the web, the basics of getting a screen reader setup on your computer, and how to operate it. You'll leave this session greater knowledge of accessible development and how to use a screen reader effectively.

**The Web is For Everyone**  
Tim Berners-Lee is noted as saying â€œthe power of the web is in its universality." The web was meant to be a great equalizer for everyone - whether you are situationally, temporarily, or permanently disabled. After all, you never know when you might break your arm or have to order pizza while holding a child. 

This talk will go over why things like inclusive design, user experience, and programming for accessibility aren't just good practices, but why they are essential to helping make the web a better place for everyone. You'll leave this session with greater knowledge of how to design and develop with accessibility in mind.

**Help My Client Needs a VPAT**  
What is a VPAT? Why do my clients keep asking about them? These questions are becoming more and more common with the rise of accessibility lawsuits. VPATs (Voluntary Product Accessibility Template) are the common ask for companies to make sure they are buying software that is accessible.

This talk will go over what a VPAT is, how to start auditing your websites for accessibility, and the basics of how to write a VPAT. You'll leave this session with a greater knowledge of accessibility, and the current legal landscape, as well as how to go back to your company and answer some of your clients questions about accessibility.
