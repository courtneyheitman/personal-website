## Project & Program Management

I frequently joke with people at work that I'm the Type A of Type As. I will organize anything, and I will make a system for it so it stays organized. 

As a former developer, when I'm working on dev teams, I want to improve the developer experience. The following are some of my favorite quotes from developers I've worked with:
* "I notice you try to schedule meetings so we will get an entire morning or afternoon of coding without meetings, and I appreciate it."
* From a developer who had just transferred off of our team "I miss your retrospectives. They were actually useful."

## Personal Life

Outside of work I often talk about farm life and what working from rural America looks like. I love spending time in the kitchen working on new recipes. My dog Peach is a smartypants and loves to make me laugh.
