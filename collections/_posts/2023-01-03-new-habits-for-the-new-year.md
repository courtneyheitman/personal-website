I'm not the traditional person who sets new years resolutions. I do see the new year as a good place to reflect and change what is or isn't working in my daily, weekly, and monthly routines.

I've noticed this last year that I haven't been doing as much self care to focus on the things that make me feel good. 

In 2022, my meditation practice fell by the way side. With getting a puppy at the end of 2021, I couldn't get into a good routine where I was practicing every day. And I do notice how much my mental health - and motivation levels in general - struggle when I'm not meditating daily. 

During lock-down in 2020, I had shifted from my normal of meditating first thing in the morning. I switched to lunchtime meditating as a way to feel like I actually had a lunch break when I wasn't leaving my house. My lunch breaks now include time outside with my dog. So, I'm planning on switching back to first thing in the morning again. 

*Trigger warning: This next section includes exercise discussion.*

I'm also hoping this will bring back my routine of working out in the morning. I'm not a person who works out for fitness goals. I work out for the endorphins. 

In the before times, I worked out with one of my coworker friends at 6:30 at work every morning. I miss waking up, meditating and going to exercise. I also miss using our water rower in the gym at work and watching the sunrise over the Missouri River.

Those are the two big habit changes that I want to make for the year. 

Do you have any habit changes that you want to make this year?
