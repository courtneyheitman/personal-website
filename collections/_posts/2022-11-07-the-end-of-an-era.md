It's been a part of my life for over 10 years. I've had the same Twitter account when I graduated high school and now through a decade of my adult life. 

I'll admit, in high school and college I didn't fully understand what to use Twitter for. As I grew into my full-time jobs, I started following more and more people in my network. As I started speaking at conferences, I found more and more friends on the app.

Now it seems like most of us on Tech Twitter are moving towards Mastodon and Discord. Some of us are moving towards personal blogs as well. It's been interesting to see how immediate the shift was.

While Twitter has it's problems with harassment and algorthmic doomscrolling, it will always be the place where I shit posted about LOLcode and got a bunch of tech bros mad at me. It will also be the place where I tweeted some wisdom in a #devdiscuss that got seen by 100,000 people.

Here's to you Bird App. Now on to the next social adventure.
