This year I am thankful for family and friends and their support, a roof over my head, and delicious food to eat. I'm thankful for books to read and shows to watch. I'm thankful to be able to work remotely so I can enjoy life in the country. I'm thankful to have a job where I geniunely get to help make the world better.

But most of all I'm thankful for my dog Peach. My velcro pup who always wants to cuddle or play. She reminds me to take breaks and always makes sure I spend time outside every day snow or shine. She's so goofy and always makes me laugh.
